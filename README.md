# FNaF-1-PSP-v1.5 

Release Notes:
-Same Asset Files from v1.4.5
-Totally re-worked and optimized source code (under the hood, v1.5 is basically a completely different game)


--Installation--

Simply place the "FNaF 1 PSP v1.5" folder in the /PSP/GAME/ directory of your memory card 
(Custom firmware is required to play)

--Testing--

Tested on the PPSSPP emulator as well as a physical PSP 3000 running ARK4 v6.60

"Five Nights At Freddy's" is a game by Scott Cawthon and I do not take any credit for the original work.
