# FNaF-1-PSP-v1.4.5
This is a playable version of my optimized FNaF Port for the PSP (Originally ported by BasDev). This update includes several optimizations to improve performance and stability during gameplay

--Notes from README.txt--
What up peeps!
A few days ago I came across the BasDev's PSP port of FNaF 1.
Although it's a very good port of the game, I've noticed that the assets used in version 1.4.0 were a little large and not very well optimized for the PSP's limited ram.

So I took it upon myself to optimize BasDev's port in an attempt to minimize the crashes experienced by the game.

I can't take any credit for BasDev's hard work to get this project off the ground, I simply made some tweaks to make his game a little easier for the PSP to process. 

What you see here is NOT the source code of the v1.4.5. 
It's simply the compiled "Ready To Play" version of the game.

--Installation--
Simply place the "FNaF 1 PSP v1.4.5" folder in the /PSP/GAME/ directory of your memory card 
(Custom firmware is required to play)

--Testing--
This version of the game was tested on both...

1.) The ppsspp emulator (set to replicate the hardware of a PSP 2000/3000)

as well as...
2.) A physical PSP 3000 running ARK-4 version 6.60

--Notes--
Testing was done on both the stock PSP CPU clock speed as well as an overclock to 333MHZ
On stock clock speeds, there are some frame rate dips when Freddy & Friends move at night. 
(Running an Overclock helps make these slowdowns less apparent)

FNaF is a game by Scott Cawthon, and the C++ code running in v1.4.5 were developed by BasDev.
