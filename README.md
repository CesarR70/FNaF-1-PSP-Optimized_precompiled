# FNaF-1-PSP-v1.5 - TESTING
Update: 9-8-2025 9:24PM EST - Testing of version 1.5 is going very well with emulation. 

There have been a multitude of code optimizations this time around that should hopefully improve battery life while gaming as well as improving performance.

I will move on to testing on real hardware and make any adjustments needed before merging v1.5 to the main branch

!! THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH !!
!! TESTING IS NOT COMPLETE YET !!

I've been looking into BaseDev's source code and was playing around with a few things in an attempt to utilize even more of the PSP's hardware when playing the game.
From my testing to create v1.4.5, i've noticed that performance always took the biggest hit whenever animatronics were moving around.

Here is a compliled version of v1.5 to hopefully cleanup some of the logic
-Cesar

--Installation--
Simply place the "FNaF 1 PSP v1.5" folder in the /PSP/GAME/ directory of your memory card 
(Custom firmware is required to play)

--Testing--
Testing is NOT complete on this version of the game!

FNaF is a game by Scott Cawthon, and the *most* C++ code running in v1.5 were developed by BasDev.
