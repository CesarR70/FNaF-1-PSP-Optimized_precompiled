# FNaF-1-PSP-v1.5 - TESTING
Update: 9-9-2025 6:06PM EST - 
Testing continues to go smoothly on v1.5

There has been a very large number of changes applied behind the scenes to the original logic of the game. 
Not much remains of BasDev's original code (asside from how save files opperate)

Any bugs that are found are quickly corrected & an updated EBOOT.PBP is applied to this branch.  

Although testing is not complete yet, I can confidently say that version 1.5 should be safe to play
Testing will continue, but Im removing the warnings from this README.  

It shouldnt be long before v1.5 is merged with the main branch



--Installation--

Simply place the "FNaF 1 PSP v1.5" folder in the /PSP/GAME/ directory of your memory card 
(Custom firmware is required to play)

--Testing--

Testing is NOT complete on this version of the game!

"Five Nights At Freddy's" is a game by Scott Cawthon and I dont not take any credit for the original work.
