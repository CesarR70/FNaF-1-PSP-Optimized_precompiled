# FNaF-1-PSP-v1.5 - TESTING
!! THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH !!
!! TESTING IS NOT COMPLETE YET !!

I've been looking into BaseDev's source code and was playing around with a few things in an attempt to utilize even more of the PSP's hardware when playing the game.
From my testing to create v1.4.5, i've noticed that performance always took the biggest hit whenever animatronics were moving around.

Here is a compliled version of v1.5 to hopefully cleanup some of the logic
-Cesar

--Installation--
Simply place the "FNaF 1 PSP v1.5" folder in the /PSP/GAME/ directory of your memory card 
(Custom firmware is required to play)

--Testing--
Testing is NOT complete on this version of the game!

FNaF is a game by Scott Cawthon, and the *most* C++ code running in v1.5 were developed by BasDev.
